## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
According to the statistics analysis we find that groun clearance and vehicle length provide a non-random amount of varience to the mpg values in the dataset. The Pr(>|t|) value for ground clearance is 5.77e-08 and the Pr(>|t|) value for  length is 2e-16. Being that both of these number are far less then 0.05 we can with a fair amount of confidence fail to reject the null hypothesis. As for the slope, we find that the length to Mpg ratio to be 6.26 which is much larger then zero. A less significant slope was the relationship between ground_clearance vs mpg which  showed a ratio of 3.56. The closest value to zero was vehicle_weright at about 1.24e-03. The overall Linear Regression model has a P value of 5.35e-11 which is below the 0.05. With that we can safely assume that the model stands a good chance at predicting Mpg for MechaCar prototype project.
